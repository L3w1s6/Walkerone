  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  ➜  Network: http://<your-network-ip>:5173/
  ➜  press h + enter to show help
```
Either of the links should work, and you should be able to use the network one on your phone as long as it's on the same wifi  
`*` To test some features you might also need the backend running 

### Backend

```
cd Backend
node server.js
```

Then you should get something like:

```
connected to server
Server started on 8000
```
`*` Make sure you have the `.env` file, if not just ask someone on discord for what should be in it
